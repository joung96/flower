N/A


If you did not meet all problem set requirements, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs. We want to give you as much partial credit as we can.
N/A


Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture
In this problem set, we set up a keyframe infrastructure to store a list of nodes. Using this new type, we used wrote an interpolation function to interpolate between the frames and construct a smooth interpolation, aka animation. We set up an infrastructure of hotkeys to allow the user to take screenshots, store frame history, playback frames, and more!

Describe steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code if your implementation strays from the assignment specification.
N/A Should adhere to the specs :)
